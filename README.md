# Lumiti (Alvine Lumiti)

Software Engineer • Data Analyst • Mobile & Web Systems Builder

I design and build production-grade software across web, mobile, and data-driven systems. My work focuses on clean architecture, performance, and practical problem-solving — not tutorials, not toy projects.

I operate comfortably across the full stack, with strong experience in backend systems, modern frontend frameworks, and mobile application development.

## What I Do

* Build scalable backend APIs and services
* Develop modern web applications (SPA & SSR)
* Engineer cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter
* Design data-driven systems and perform analysis

I am a **practicing developer**. University is incidental — not my identity.
